When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository as I would use Drop Box or Google Drive. I would
use it when I want to work on my project on multiple computers. This will be helpful if 
I want to switch from my laptop to working on my desktop. It will also allow for easy 
collaboration with others, since we all won't be working on the same machine...
hopefully, haha.
