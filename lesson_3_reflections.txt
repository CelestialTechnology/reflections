When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository as I would use Drop Box or Google Drive. I would
use it when I want to work on my project on multiple computers. This will be helpful if 
I want to switch from my laptop to working on my desktop. It will also allow for easy 
collaboration with others, since we all won't be working on the same machine...
hopefully, haha.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone of a repository done on the GitHub server/web site. It allows me to make modifications to the repository
 without it affecting the owners original repository, but still giving credit to the original owner.

A clone is a copy of a repository made from the GitHub server to my local machine. It allows me to make changes locally, 
and choose what to push to the main GitHub server.

A branch makes a copy of the main master branch and allows me to make changes without affecting the master branch. I can
 then merge those changes on the other branch to the master branch when I feel the new feature or reason I made the 
 branch is ready.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

 This is beneficial to know the last known state so we can do comparisons with our most up to date version of the remote that is stored online. We couldn't do that if the remote wasn't stored locally.
