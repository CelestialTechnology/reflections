What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, it creates an empty .git repo to be used to track my file changes as I commit them. I would need to do this if I want to be able to track my project commit history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is different in that it is the middle ground. It gives you a chance to choose what you want to commit and make changes to it first. Because once you commit, it is committed. The staging area gives you a chance to logically process what you want to stage.
